into\nthe constructor of the terminal component, and the constructor is\nexecuted before any lifecycle hooks, thus \"child\" (the selector of the underlying xterm)\nis undefined because it has not been created yet (remember, that happens\nduring the ngAfterViewInit() lifecycle event.\nTo avoid this issue, we can pass a standard\"xterm terminal (since \"under the hood\", NgTerminal\nis an xterm terminal with a lot of added Angular functionality), because terminal does not\nrely on any lifecycle methods to mount and render.\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n

NG-Xterm, meaning it does a little bit of\neverything. All though some may have argued for breaking  into smaller\nutility classes, I find it easier to have everything in one place.\nThis prevents having to chase down various imports when examining

a Linux and Mac OS user (mostly Mac), I spend a lot of time at the terminal. While there are several amazing terminal emulators available such as Hyper and iTerm2, I wanted to build my own.\nCurrently Versions:\n\nAngular v12.0.3\nElectron v13.1.1\nElectron Builder v22.10.5\n\nGotchas\n\nHot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process is not able to be hot reloaded, only\nrestarted.\n\n\nAngular 11.x CLI needs Node 10.13 or later to work correctly.\nIf you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you MUST install @angular/cli installed\non your system. Please see Angular-cli documentation for further assistance.`\n\nGetting Started\nClone this repository locally:\ngit clone https://github.com/payneusmc07/ng-xterm.gitInstall dependencies with yarn or npm:\nyarn installWords of warning\nNode-pty (what is used by ng-xterm to spawn terminal sessions) is what is known as a Native Module.\nThis means it is written in C/C++ and complied for use with Node/Electron. Native Modules can be very finicky, \nand Node-pty is notorious for causing development headaches.\nIf you try to build/run ng-xterm and you see errors in the developer tools which say something\nalong the lines of:\nCannot find file \"../Debug/node-pty.node\"then node-pty needs to be rebuild for the current version of Node/Electron you are using.\nThere are two scripts in package.json to help accomplish this.\n\npostinstall: Utilizes Electron Builder to rebuild any Native Modules, this is automatically run\nafter installing/removing dependencies.\n\n\nrebuild:pty: Uses Electron Rebuild.\n\n\nthere is also a third (but not as effective method) to rebuild Node-pty, using NPM to rebuild the associated binary\nfiles. To use NPM, just run:\n\nnpm rebuild node-pty --update-binaries\nTo make life easier for future users/developers, I included the rebuild:pty in the post install script \nso Electron Rebuild is automatically run after each dependency update. I did this because\nduring the course of developing ng-xterm, I  found when using \"brand new\" versions of Electron,\n(such as 13.0+) that Electron Builder did not always get the job done for rebuilding Node-pty. \n\nImportant Commands\nFor IntelliJ/Webstorm users\nThe included .run folder contains pre-configured scripts which you should be able\nto load and run without any configuration. These scripts contain the needed environment variables\nto develop NG-Xterm.\nFor Non IntelliJ/Webstorm users\nThe included .run folder also contains VSCode tasks for running in development\nand building NG-Xterm for production.\nIf you are not using the included script files\nYou will need to set your environment variables manually.\nInstall and rebuild dependencies\nyarn initRun the main and renderer process in development mode\nPlease make sure to set the following environment variables if you are not using the included scripts.\n\nDEV_URL=http://localhost:4200\nNODE_ENV=development\n\nyarn devBuild the renderer (Angular) process. Your built files are in the /dist folder.\nyarn build:prodBuild the main process only.\nNote: Please make sure you have run build:prod \nas Electron will look for the static index.html file.\nyarn build:electron-onlyBuild only the main process in production mode\nplease make sure to set the following environment variable if you are not using the included scripts.\n\nNODE_ENV=productionyarn build:electron-only:all\n\nBuild NG-Xterm for all platforms, but nothing is published to Git.\nplease make sure to set the following environment variable if you are not using the included scripts.\n\nNODE_ENV=productionyarn build:final:all-platforms:no-publish\n\nBuild NG-Xterm for all platforms, and the completed app is published to Git.\nyarn build:final:all-platforms:publisGenerate documentation\nyarn compodocDocumentation\nIt has always been a pet peeve of mine when a program or code base is not properly documented (you know who you are).\nWith this in mind, I know some of you may feel the amount of documentation/comments I included is a bit excessive, but I would rather have \"too much\" and sleep better knowing everything is properly documented.\n\nThe majority of the documentation was generated with the compodoc package.\nThe code is also heavily commented.\n\nCommon Questions\n\nWhy are some of the function names so long?\n\nThose of you familiar with Objective C/Swift background know how \"verbose\" the function names/parameters can be. \n  And seeing as I am also an Objective C/Swift, I brought that convention over with me, mostly\nout of habit, but I feel it makes it easier to understand what the code is doing\nsince some of its functionality is described in the function/method name.\n\nWhy are certain class members not marked as private when they\ncan or should be?\n\nDue to the nature of the new Angular compiler and rendering system (Ivy),\nvariables that will be used in the html template cannot be marked as private,\nsince they cannot be resolved by the compiler. An example of this can be seen\nin the code snippet from the app-root component. Since the class member\nidFromTab: number | string is used in the html template, it must remain public.\n\n/** The id of the currently selected tab in the tabs component. */\nidFromTab: number | string\n\n/**\n * Angular will throw the following error if idFromTab \n * is made private.\n *\n * Private field idFromTab cannot be resolved from the\n * component template when using the AOT compiler\n * */\nprivate idFromTab: number | string\n\n\n\nWhy are public classes/functions not explicitly marked as public?\nBy default, methods and classes are public in Typescript, so I did not feel\nthe need to repeat the obvious. Aside from that, when you are working with classes\nwhich have a lot of memeber methods, it can become easy to mistake public for private if you are not paying attention.\nWhy is eslint not installed?\nSeeing as NG-Xterm was developed soley by me, I did not feel adding something which monitors my\nalready consistent coding style was needed.\nForms\nHow the various settings forms work.\nThe code snippet below was taken from the ng-xterm-tab-settings component.\nSince Reactive forms in Angular can be a bit confusing, I thought I would provide\na bit of a break down as to how the various forms were configured, and how each setting\nis retrieved from the terminal settings store.\nPlease note, not all comments or functions will be a complete refection of the actual code.\nThis page is meant as more of a walkthrough/demo.\nimport { Component, OnInit } from \"@angular/core\"\nimport { FormControl, FormGroup } from \"@angular/forms\"\nimport { SettingsService } from \"@shared/services\"\nimport { Settings } from \"@shared/utils\"\n\n@Component({\n    selector: \"ng-xterm-tab-settings\",\n    templateUrl: \"./tab-settings.component.html\",\n    styleUrls: [\"./tab-settings.component.scss\"]\n})\n\n/** The form which modifies any settings related to the ng-xterm-tab-settings component */\nexport class TabSettingsComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    /** Define the basic form which modifies any settings related to the ng-xterm-tab-settings component */\n    tabSettingsForm: FormGroup\n\n    /**\n     * A string value which will represent the preferred background color\n     * for the UI tabs. This value will be retrieved from the settings store.\n     * */\n    tabBackgroundColor: string\n\n    /** By \"declaring\" the various services used by this component in the constructor, \n     * we allow for the Angular dependency injection (DI) mechanisms to properly configure\n     * and instantiate the service class(es) for us. When using DI, we DO NOT instantiate \n     * the service class(es) with the \"new\" keyword. \n     * */\n    constructor(private readonly settingsService: SettingsService) {}\n\n    /**\n     * Since Electron Store returns an \"unknown\" value, each retrieved settings\n     * must be type cast to a specific value. Otherwise, Typescript will throw error code\n     * TS2322: Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type '[stored value]'.\n     * */\n    ngOnInit() {\n        // DO NOT DO THIS!\n        this.settingsService = new SettingsService()\n\n        // retrieve the background color from the settings store. and type cast it to a string\n        this.tabBackgroundColor = this.settingsService.getItem( Settings.TAB_BG_COLOR) as string\n\n        this.tabSettingsForm = new FormGroup({\n            // the name of the form control: instantiate a new FormControl with an optional default value\n            \"tab-background\": new FormControl(this.tabBackgroundColor),\n        })\n    }\n}A Big Thank You To\n\nVercel for giving us Hyper, which served as a large
